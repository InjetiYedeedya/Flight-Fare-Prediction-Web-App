# **Flight Fare Prediction Web App**  

ðŸš€ Live Demo: [Flight Fare Prediction](https://flight-fare-prediction-web-app-041a274343e8.herokuapp.com/)  

---

## **Project Overview**  
This web application predicts flight fares based on user inputs such as airline, source, destination, departure date, arrival date, and total stops. It leverages a Machine Learning model built using `scikit-learn` and is deployed using `Flask` on `Heroku`.  

---

## **Project Structure**  
The project is organized into the following key components:  
```plaintext
Flight-Fare-Prediction-Web-App/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                # Flask app and routing logic
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py              # ML model training and saving
â”œâ”€â”€ best_model.pkl        # Serialized ML model
â”œâ”€â”€ Data_Train.xlsx       # Training dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ Test_set.xlsx         # Testing dataset
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt      # Required Python packages
â”œâ”€â”€ Procfile              # Heroku deployment configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Input form for prediction
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ result.html       # Result display page
â””â”€â”€ static/
    â”œâ”€â”€ css/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css     # Custom styling for the web app
    â””â”€â”€ images/
        â””â”€â”€ new_image.png # Images used in the app
```

## **How It Works**  
1. User provides flight details like airline, source, destination, departure date, arrival date, and total stops.  
2. The details are sent to the backend where the pre-trained ML model processes the inputs.  
3. The model predicts the flight fare and displays the result on a separate page.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Materialize Framework)  
- **Deployment**: Heroku  

---

## **Model Training**  
1. The model is trained using the dataset `Data_Train.xlsx` which contains historical flight fare data.  
2. The model uses features like airline, source, destination, departure date, arrival date, and total stops.  
3. The best model is saved as `best_model.pkl` for prediction.  

To **train the model**, run:  
```bash
python model.py
```

---

## **Local Setup and Installation**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flight-Fare-Prediction-Web-App.git
cd Flight-Fare-Prediction-Web-App
```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**:  
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For MacOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Required Packages**:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create the Model File**:  
```bash
python model.py
```

5. **Run the Application**:  
```bash
python app.py
```

6. **Access the App**:  
Open the browser and navigate to: (https://flight-fare-prediction-web-app-041a274343e8.herokuapp.com/)

---

## **Deployment on Heroku**  
1. **Login to Heroku**:  
```bash
heroku login
```

2. **Create a New Heroku App**:  
```bash
heroku create your-app-name
```

3. **Add Heroku Remote Repository**:  
```bash
git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git
```

4. **Deploy to Heroku**:  
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push heroku master
```

5. **Open the Deployed App**:  
```bash
heroku open
```

6. **View Logs** (for troubleshooting):  
```bash
heroku logs --tail
```
